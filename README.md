## 📌 Project Overview

This notebook is a **comprehensive R programming guide** that covers:

- Basics of R syntax and operations  
- Reading and writing files  
- Random number generation  
- Loops and conditional statements  
- Data frames and dataset manipulation  
- Plotting (scatter, line, histogram, functions)  
- Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) using TOPSIS  
- Model evaluation parameters for regression and classification  
- Working with `dplyr` for dataset manipulation  

It is designed for **self-learning and practical experimentation** in R.

## 📌 Sections Covered

### 1. Simple Examples

- Addition of two numbers  
- Using variables and functions (`exp()`, `log()`)  
- Random number generation with `runif()`  
- Basic operations: min, max, sum, mean, standard deviation  
- Loops (`for`) and conditional statements (`if-else`)  

---

### 2. File Operations

- Writing data to CSV files (`write.csv`)  
- Reading data from CSV files (`read.csv`)  
- Calculating model evaluation parameters (SOD, MAE, correlation, R-Square, Accuracy)  
- Saving results to files  

---

### 3. Data Frames

- Generate random matrices  
- Merge matrices into data frames  
- Rename columns and manage column names  
- Summarize dataset (`summary()`)  
- Select rows and columns, top/bottom rows, random rows  
- Shuffle and split dataset into training and testing  

---

### 4. Plotting in R

- Basic plots and scatter plots  
- Titles, axis labels, and colors  
- Bivariate plots  
- Overlaying points, lines, and steps  
- Histograms and boxplots  
- Plotting mathematical functions (`sin`, `cos`, custom functions)  
- Saving plots to files (`png()`)  

---

### 5. Working with iris Dataset using `dplyr`

- Selecting columns using `select()`  
- Filtering rows with `filter()`  
- Creating new columns using `mutate()`  
- Sorting datasets using `arrange()`  

---

### 6. Dataset Manipulation

- Merge datasets column-wise (`cbind`) and row-wise (`rbind`)  
- Merge datasets using `merge()` function  
- Apply functions row-wise and column-wise using `apply()`
